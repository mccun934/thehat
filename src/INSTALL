Prerequisites:
	Ruby 1.8 or newer
	GraphViz - recent-ish version s/b fine
	These gems:
		inifile
		fastercsv
		icalendar
		Ruby-IRC (for the IRC client)

Put wfengine.rb and wfrenderers.rb somewhere in the ruby include path, 
or just leave them in the same directory as the frontends (thehat-tty and thehat-irc)
if you intend to start the programs in the same directory as the libraries.

thehat-tty is about as simple as it gets.  There's one user (you) at a command
prompt in a terminal session, and that's it.  There's no clock thread, so if you
want to test timings you'll have to issue a tictoc command to the interpreter.

thehat-irc is a multi-user version that camps on an IRC channel and does its thing.
This one has a clock thread that will broadcast the results of clock events into
the irc channel it's camped on.

You can put the frontends anywhere, including on your path if you want. Just be sure
the *.rb files are somehow available to ruby ( ruby -e 'puts $:' ).

See README for configuration details.
