To run the workflow system in a as an IRC bot, do the following:
 * Install the system per the [wiki:configuration configuration instructions]
 * In the !TheHat directory, run ./thehat-irc yourconfig.yaml

The bot will join the channel you set in the configuration file.  You should join that channel as well with your favorite IRC client.

In the IRC channel, you interact with the bot by saying "botnic command [<options>]"

 * Get a list of all the workflows available: "botnic ls"
 * Load one of the listed workflows: "botnic load <workflowname>"
 * Visit the link that the bot now mentions - your graph should be there.
 * Claim some steps: "botnic gimme <stepname>[,<stepname>[,...]]"
 * Get someone else to join the channel and ask them to claim some steps as well
 * Go through the workflow like this:
 * When a step that you own comes up, it'll say so in IRC. To indicate that you've started the step, say 'botnic start <stepname>'
 * When you want to say you've finished the step, say 'botnic finish <stepname>'

Check out this [wiki:sampleSession sample session] for a detailed walkthrough of a simple workflow.

Following this procedure, your workflow will proceed 'til the last of its steps are performed - at the end of the workflow, the bot will announce workflow completion.

Congrats - you just ran your first workflow!
